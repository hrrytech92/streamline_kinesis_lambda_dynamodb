# streamline_kinesis_lambda_dynamodb

## ðŸ§ª Use Case

> This project can be adapted for use cases such as real-time analytics, clickstream tracking, IoT event ingestion, or log processing pipelines.

- **Simulated Events**: A Python script continuously pushes random event data into a Kinesis stream.
- **Kinesis Data Stream**: Captures streaming data and triggers a Lambda function.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes each event and stores it in a DynamoDB table.
- **DynamoDB**: Serves as the persistent storage layer for processed events.
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Monitors the Lambda execution for debugging and observability.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python** for simulation and Lambda function
- **AWS Kinesis** for real-time data ingestion
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless processing
- **AWS DynamoDB** for persistent event storage
- **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logs
